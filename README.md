# Birds! 

I wanted to create a bird classifier project because I like birds & machine learning! 

This month I've been in a study group with a bunch of my friends as we work through the videos in [Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks Zero to Hero Series](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html). And Wow!! I am learning so much. 

I am getting a great overview of neural networks in general. Even in this short project I was able to apply some of that knowledge. Specifically - 
- tensor size mismatch - I had a tensor size mismatch because the model required RGB but some of the images are RGBA. To accommodate, I had to reformat the pictures into RGB. This type of matrix multiplication sizing mismatch comes up a lot in my study group! 
- our study group focuses a lot on gradient descent, but you can see in the bird project code that we actually call pytorch's `torch.no_grad():` . Our bird model is a pre-trained model and we're not going to train or optimize this model further. Therefore, in this case, it doesn't make sense to waste compute cycles on gradient descent if we already have the model trained. 

### Here's how I did this: 

- there's actually a huggingface pre-trained library for birds! So Easy - https://huggingface.co/chriamue/bird-species-classifier . Looks like it was created 9 months ago (Nov 2023) - crazy how fast ML is moving - so exciting. 
- I used streamlit for the gui - so easy and chatGPT is a pro at it ðŸ˜œ


### Demo

- as of 8/10/2024, this project needs some improvement! Check out my demo here :

1. Are you a better bird watcher than this huggingface model? Prove it- reach out and show me which ones huggingface got wrong! 

2. Any ideas for how to fine tune or otherwise improve this model to be better at Florida birds?? 


### Pics
- My best friend Andrea is a biologist in Florida and takes the best bird pictures. I just gathered some off my phone to use for this project, but Andrea was the one who took most of them - so thanks Andrea!

### Software 

I'm a fan of pipenv to manage my dependencies. 

Here's your dependencies: 

- pipenv install : 
- transformers
- torch
- torchvision
- Pillow (in the code you'll see it as PIL, but PIL didn't work for me, I had to do Pillow)
- streamlit

here's that all together
```
pipenv install transformers torch torchvision Pillow streamlit
```

### How to run 
`streamlit run birds.py`

- upload a png file 
- check out my folder "bird_pics" for some samples
- you can also switch it to jpg or other file types by modifying the code slightly 


### Things I learned
- RGB vs RBGA - Andrea's camera is fancy and uses RGBA (alpha channel)
- I had to add a line of code 
```
if image.mode != 'RGB':
    image = image.convert('RGB') 
```
- this puts all the images into RGB 

### To Do 
*stuff I want to do to improve this*
- [ ] feed it videos
- [ ] how to improve this model so it is better with florida birds? 
- [âœ…] give it a drag and drop 
interface and deploy it so other people can use it   - Done! Thanks Streamlit
